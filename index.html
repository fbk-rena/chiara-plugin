    <h2 class="text-center text-white" > Chiara Bautista</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="text-center text-white">Chiara Bautista is an illustrator and graphic artist based out of Tucson, Arizona. By day, she is an illustrator for the Arizona Daily Star; but by night she goes by Milk, producing her own beautifully tragic illustrations. <br>
    Chiaraâ€™s illustrations are both beautiful and tragic, each telling its own story about love, longing, heartbreak, and betrayal, all with a fairytale twist. One of the more spellbinding things about her art is that a good deal of her imagery references stories told between Chiara and her muse, Ilka. These two have never met in person, but have held an online relationship for years. One can only assume that these visual tales of tragic romance amongst the characters pertain to Chiara and Ilka.</p>
